      <h2 id="description">Description.</h2>
<p>Character Building Season (CBS) is an orientation program created by the Informatics Student Association (Himpunan Mahasiswa Teknik Informatika / Himatif) for newly enrolled Informatics students. This program spans for 2/3 of the first semester and includes activities such as an introduction to the Informatics Undergraduate Program environment, Computer Science-related workshops, organizational and leadership training, trivia, and games. Those who pass this orientation program will become a member of Himatif and will be able to serve within the association and take part in its activities.</p>
<p>There are several tasks that a new student must complete to pass the orientation program, a few of which are done through the CBS website via the features available there. Those tasks are acquaintanceships and quizzes. The acquaintanceship task requires the students to meet with their seniors in person and get to know them better. As proof of acquaintanceship, the students must take a picture of themselves with the seniors and upload it to the CBS website. Afterwards, a CBS committee member will manually validate if the meeting took place. As for the quiz task, the website will display a tree diagram of Himatf organizational structure with placeholders assigned to each organizational position, at the bottom are the photos of the organization members corresponding to the structure. The student&rsquo;s task is to click and drag the photos of each member to their correct placeholders in the structure.</p>
<p>The Github repository link is not available because this code is proprietary.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background.</h2>
<p>This project was assigned to me when I was the head of Developer Community (Devcom), a community under Himatif&rsquo;s supervision that revolves around Software Engineering and Computer Science. The website existed and was already in use one year my assignment, but since software is &ldquo;never completely finished&rdquo;, the head of the CBS committee asked me to add new features and polish existing ones. And so I did, along with my two friends who were also members of Devcom. We were tasked with creating a manual photo validation system for the acquaintanceship task, as well as solving bugs and maintaining the existing features and database.</p>
